[music]

3
00:00:26,850 --> 00:01:29,390
[music] It

4
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:40,720
was hard to part with their comrades,

5
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:44,200
but for them the death of the colonel

6
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,399
marked the end of their journey and the beginning of a new

7
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,479
life on the shores of Lake Baikal.  For me,

8
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:54,560
this path became a boundary, a

9
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:58,560
boundary between the order and life, between

10
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:02,360
duty and the dream of seeing my father.

11
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:06,360
And just like Artyum, I chose my dream and

12
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,360
went after it.

13
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:13,200
On the way, it sometimes seemed to me that the

14
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:17,040
trees, runes, and leaning poles that remained behind me were

15
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,680
simply an endless

16
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:24,480
movie on a tattered screen.

17
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,840
And I am a midnight spectator, sitting in an empty

18
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,000
hall.

19
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,800
But each morning, rising directly in line with the

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,879
sun, brought a change of scenery,

21
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,840
instilling confidence that I was nevertheless

22
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,840
approaching the ocean.

23
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:55,200
One step, then another step and another,

24
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:57,680
despite any obstacles.

25
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,440
Someday, relaxing on the porch of my

26
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,080
father's house,

27
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,560
I might want to write a book about

28
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,560
this coming

29
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:16,080
someday, but not today.

30
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,879
I'm at the city where the

31
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,879
final stage of my journey is to begin,

32
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:26,760
and I can already smell the pestilence.  If I

33
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:30,680
really have a chance to get home, I will

34
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,680
find it here.

35
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,400
Hello, Vlade Vok

36
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,889
[music]

37
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,520
Better get lost.   Be

38
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,000
careful not to knock it over.

39
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:29,120
Shoot only at the legs, [ __ ].

40
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,759
I warn you, the

41
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,759
next shot will be to kill.

42
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,280
Hey, you, captain, [ __ ] come out with your

43
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,919
hands up.

44
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,639
What else do you need?

45
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:53,120
That's it, nothing more is needed.  You won't

46
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,039
fail, son.  The lawyer wants to take you alive

47
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,400
.

48
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:01,039
How do you know what he wants there?

49
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,960
There is such a thing, I understand.  In short, Sha,

50
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:07,400
Bazar, come out already.

51
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:11,240
Where should I go out?  Show yourself.

52
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,240
Come here,

53
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,319
thank you.

54
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,280
I think they're gone.

55
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,319
Thanks for your help.  Come up here.   Let's

56
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,319
chat.

57
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:36,319
Now.

58
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:05,400
Ah, [ __ ], I got you.

59
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,400
Where did you come from?

60
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:10,840
Come on, go

61
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,840
fly.

62
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:20,080
Anu, put the weapon away.

63
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:20,080
Woah, easy there.  I helped.

64
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,520
And I say, clean it up quickly.

65
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,440
Please, I don't need any trouble.  Yashch

66
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,879
ship, I need to go home.  You don't know anything

67
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,160
suitable here.

68
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:37,680
Well, we only have one ship, but it’s

69
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,680
suitable.  Come on, I'll show you.   Be

70
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:58,759
careful here, otherwise you'll end up with a

71
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:02,440
handsome guy.

72
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:04,360
Everyone is after me.  They want to serve before the commission

73
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:08,039
.

74
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:11,800
Well, at least we're holding back.

75
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:14,280
Well, go ahead and get it.  Do you see it over there?

76
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:18,360
Vaurine.

77
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:21,159
And how healthy she is.  A good ticket home.

78
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,080
By the way, where is your house?  Somehow your

79
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:25,440
accent seems suspiciously familiar to me.

80
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,599
Sandiego.

81
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,000
Oops, another American.  What do you have here

82
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:33,519
smeared with honey?

83
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,640
Another.

84
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:39,039
You really don't seem to know, so

85
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:41,680
I'll tell you, but later.

86
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,320
We're packing up.

87
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,560
What the hell?   I

88
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,600
noticed the wings.

89
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,200
Let's leave before we get hit.

90
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,200
Damn, we're late.

91
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,519
Get out of here.

92
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:50,399
A

93
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:18,679

Ah.

97
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,720
And

98
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,480
Policho already put your

99
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,759
hands up.

100
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:09,440
Come with us.

101
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,440
Rajivyeom.

102
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,000
Go to

103
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,279
kill

104
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,299
[music]

105
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yeah.   Back

106
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,399
off.

107
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,240
Oh,

108
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,240
 

109
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,320
leave me alone for now.

110
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:29,160
Well, have you jumped enough, bull?

111
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:32,759
And [ __ ].

112
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,759
Ah, [ __ ].   I'm

113
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:50,199
telling you exactly.  I heard him swearing

114
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:52,759
while they were tying him up.  [ __ ] and olol goats.  Hey, I'm

115
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:54,639
American.  This

116
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:56,959
Russian isn't very good.  How do you know it's

117
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,319
American?

118
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,759
Well, I don’t know, but I heard about it in the movies before the war

119
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:04,440
.

120
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,440
So he can too.

121
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,560
By the way, he came to his senses.

122
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,319
Hey, where are you from?

123
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,920
From Moscow.

124
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:18,839
Listen, you're not an American by any chance, are you?

125
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,839
No, damn, Buryats.

126
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,720
American.

127
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,720
American.

128
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,560
Yeah, well you see,

129
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,560
someone tried to screw us over, but it didn't

130
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,560
help.

131
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,279
The day, I say, is not my day.

132
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,959
Looks like it.

133
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:43,040
Well, never mind, maybe you'll even be happy.

134
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,880
Guys, it turns out we

135
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,519
got an American.  I need to call the cat and report.

136
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:51,040
Wow.  Come on,

137
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:52,720
I'm a courier.  Give me the cat.  Here's news for

138
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,959
him.

139
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,959
He is not on the bridge, please wait.

140
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:01,319
Okay, let's wait.

141
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:04,319
Turn off the engine, bros.  We're waiting for the boss.

142
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:04,319
Frets.

143
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,679
By the way, regarding the question about not being your day.

144
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:14,720
See what's there?

145
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:18,280
I see.  Clouds.

146
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:21,720
Clouds.  This is brother Purya.

147
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:25,480
Exactly, Storm.  And they are not simple here.   If

148
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:29,520
you get into one of these, you'll be in trouble.

149
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:31,679
So we're lucky we accepted you.

150
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,640
Courier, boss on the bridge.  I'm switching to

151
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,760
it.

152
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,520
Good.

153
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,720
Get started and let's get on the boat.

154
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,960
Well, what's up, Urus?  Have you conveyed the proposal to the captain

155
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,640
?

156
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,760
No, some riff-raff scared him off, but there

157
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,640
was one guy with him.  We took it just in

158
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:50,880
case.  Turned out to be an American.

159
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,880
In your death?

160
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,159
You're insulting me, boss.  He swore like you do on your worst

161
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:00,960
days.

162
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:00,960
Give this American a rod.

163
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,320
America is

164
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:21,280
going crazy.

165
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:26,000
I don't really believe it myself.

166
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,000
Wow.  So that's it.  Couriers of

167
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,280
this guest.  Clear.  Bring him here quickly.

168
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,200
End of communication.

169
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,039
Eat.  Boss.   Do

170
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:41,360
you see the effect?  And who understood everything right away

171
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:41,360
?  Who said you're American?  Ah,

172
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,919
wow, our

173
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:52,360
healthy fool wax.   Yeah, right.

174
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:52,360

175
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:05,720
Look, it's the boss.

176
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,200
This is him.

177
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:14,200
It's me.

178
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,520
Why haven't they untied you?

179
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,520
And

180
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,520
now

181
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:29,400
I ask for a set.

182
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:31,640
Well, take the guest to the gangway.

183
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,799
There is a boss.

184
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,919
Damn, the cat is angry.   I

185
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,240
should have untied him right away.

186
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:42,520
Got it for untying.

187
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:46,320
Sometimes you can't please a cat at all.

188
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,320
Looks like this isn't our day.

189
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,200
Well, your patronymic has arrived.  Come

190
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,200
on board.

191
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,960
Otherwise it's time to hide.  The storm is about

192
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,960
to start.

193
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:22,919
So where do you want your ticket?

194
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,960
To Sanego

195
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:27,440
California.

196
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:32,200
This is where Paradise on earth was.  But if you don't

197
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:34,799
count the rush hour traffic, of course.

198
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,080
Listen, remind me, what was the

199
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:40,080
name of your baseball team?

200
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,080
Padres.

201
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,440
Exactly.  Our team played with them often.  I'm

202
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,080
with Atlas too.

203
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,080
Riners, that's if you still think I'm a prostitute

204
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,080
.

205
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,120
Nothing personal, Corporal.  Times are

206
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,120
so difficult right now.
